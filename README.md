# Overview

I wanted to learn how to work with MySQL databases through a life-applicable scenerio as I play DnD a lot and having a database on hand would be nice.

DnDatabase works by using a python library to connect and query a MySQL Database. You need to run DnDatabase for the main program. If you want to make changes to the tables within
the database, change the sql_scripts within the update_tables.py file. Also update the print_table.py to reflect queries that you want to make.
